        All sales are final and no refunds will be given.
         Once a course or program has been purchased, the student will not be 
         entitled to a refund for any reason, including but not limited to
          dissatisfaction with the course or program content, inability to 
          complete the course or program, or failure to pass any assessments 
          or exams. In the event of a technical issue that affects a studentâ€™s
          ability to access the course or program, the education website will make every effort to resolve the issue in a timely manner, but will not issue a refund. By purchasing a course or program, the student agrees to this no refund policy.
